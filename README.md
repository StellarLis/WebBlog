A website where users can post their blogs.

# Stack:

## Frontend:

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Formik and Yup

## Backend:

- NestJS
- PostgreSQL
- Sequelize ORM
- JWT (for authentication)
- Swagger (for documentation)
- Jest (Unit testing)

## How to use:

- Clone this repository
- Make sure you have opened PostgreSQL instance on your computer on port **5432**.
- Go to the `/server` folder and run `npm install`.
- In that folder, open `.development.env` file and provide your hostname, port, username, password and database name of your PostgreSQL database.
- In `/server` folder run `npm run start:dev`
- Go to `/client` folder and run `npm install`, then run `npm start`.

  Now, you should have an app opened on port 5000, so now you can open http://localhost:5000/ link.
