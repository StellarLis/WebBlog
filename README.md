# WebBlog2

A better version of my previous web app where you can post your blogs. Also you have your profile page with a list of your own blogs.

# Stack:
## Frontend:
* React
* Tailwind CSS
* Formik and Yup

## Backend:
* NestJS
* PostgreSQL
* Sequelize ORM
* JWT (for authentication)
* Swagger (for documentation)

## How to use:
* Clone this repository
* Make sure you have opened PostgreSQL instance on your computer on port **5432**.
* Go to the `/server` folder and run `npm install`.
* In that folder, open `/src/app.module.ts` file and provide your hostname, port, username, password and database name of your PostgreSQL database.
* In `/server` folder run `npm run start:dev`
* Go to `/client` folder and run `npm install`, then run `npm start`.

Now, you should have an app opened on port `3000`, so now you can open http://localhost:3000/ link.
